# Book-to-ChatGPT-Prompt
This is a simple software that turns any book into chatgpt prompt and you can ask any question related to that book.{Can't seem to do it for free though}.
You can test it out in google colab, you can do it in your local machine as well but i think gdrive connection code has to be modified.
